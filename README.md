# SPACE SHOOTER Game

## Introduction
This game is based on the popular 20's game named **Space Shooter** which we all enjoyed playing in our childhood. This game is developed by [**Aadesh Dahal**](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100086562643929), **Nishchal Pokhrel**, **Nandini Karn** and **Karuna Shrestha** as a first year project in the project demonstration organized by [ACES](https://www.facebook.com/acesdharan), Dharan.

## My process

The teachings in my college was enough to understand basics of the game that were used in the game. But I used a library called SFML to build the graphics and setup the controls in the game. To learn more about SFML, initially i watched few youtube videos to easily lay hand on the library. After I got to more about the library it was a easy process. I took few help from the AI chatbots to debug my errors and bugs in my code. Code is being executed properly but there are some room for improvements in my code.

## Requirements 

Code is properly working and has no faults but the library used up need to be setup properly. You need SFML library compatible with your mingW. I recommend using the following SFML version and mingW version in your computer to execute this code and properly enjoy the game: 
* (SMFL-2.5.1-windows-gcc-7.3.0)[https://sourceforge.net/projects/sfml.mirror/files/2.5.1/SFML-2.5.1-windows-gcc-7.3.0-mingw-64-bit.zip/download]
* (mingw-W64-possix-seh-rt-v6-rev0.7z)[https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-posix/seh/x86_64-8.1.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0.7z/download]
